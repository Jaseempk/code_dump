        ": I recently asked this question on the daily questions sub on r/running.\n\nOne of the best advice i received was that if you're a beginner runner, zone training is not going to apply to you as your HR will reach Zone 3/4 even on easy runs. According to them, Zone based training will come into play after around 1-2 years of consistent training. A better alternative will be to base your runs on RPE, Rate of Perceived Exertion. If you have can have full conversations, then you're in an Easy run. If you can only speaks 3-4 words at a time, you're at tempo pace.\n\nI hope this helps.\n[u/simonrunbundle (5 pts)]: Don't base any calculation on your age. You need to know your true maximum heart rate, which will be individual to you. As an example, I am 47 and my max HR is 202. The most popular",
        "breathing differently, and adopting a more shuffling gait (tip of the hat to Alberto Salazar). 6 workouts is not enough to affect a large physiological change. I sincerely hope the gains continue, and that those gains translate into a faster race pace. I can only assume the mechanism of that improvement is in increased stroke volume. \n\nIf you can address any of what I am encountering, or make a case for this type of training based on scientific principles, or even offer anecdotal evidence that will help me keep grinding, please comment.\n[u/baddspellar (8 pts)]: Basing your training on heart rate zones is sound science. Your heart rate is \\*your\\* heart rate, Age based formulas are absolutely useless.  My max has always been unusually low for my age. I'm your age and I do very well in my",
        "(84% max HR), which according to everything I\u2019ve read *should* feel intense. This was also at a consistent pace. But it was beyond manageable. I could pass the talk test no problem and was not really breathing that heavily. This is generally how my runs go.\n\nSo my question is, do I up the intensity to a level that does feel exerting and ignore heart rate or am I missing something?\n\nThanks!\n[u/Riker-Bob (8 pts)]: If you know your exact max. HR you can use the zones. But it\u2019s sometimes difficult to find out without doing tests like the VO2max test with special equipment. On the other hand you can pretty much relay on your own feeling and the \u201ctalk test\u201d. You can also compare your stats with someone of similar sex,age and fitness level. Oh and also the heart rate monitor you are using might",

As you say depending on what method you use to calculate Max HR, as a 51 Year Old I feel like I am training my aerobic zone as I walk from couch to fridge!  What I will say however is that as I trained and tried to stay true I have been able to increase pace and duration while staying close or a few beats above my 80% numbers.   So I know it works but it is not my preferred way of training.  I generally try to use perceived effort now and let HR ago where it may.  \n\nHaving said all that I have a \u201cthrow away\u201d observation/discovery that I will share.

Run at the pace where you can speak a whole sentence. That would roughly be in heart rate zones one/two.\n\nI typically, when going easy, run at the pace slightly lower than the effort where I start noticing my breathing getting deeper and slightly laboured. That is towards the top end of zone two for me.\n  [u/Supreme_couscous (13 pts)]: Yep I think breathing and exertion is a better indicator of zones rather than going simply by the numbers, as the number can vary by age, temperature, time of day etc.\n[u/ClarkWGrizzball (27 pts)]: You need to figure out what your HR zones are, for a",
        ".\n\nYou are probably running your easy runs too hard if your HR is climbing to 180+. Your easy pace is probably more like 8:00/km. If you like training based on HR, then take a walk break when your HR crosses over to zone 3. And make sure you set your HR zones right. Don't use the 220-age formula. Use the max HR from your most recent 5k event. Then use the %HRR (heart rate reserve) formula to calculate your zones, not %max HR.",

My knee which had been giving a few twinge the week before the race felt perfect. We caught and overtook the 4:50 bus despite keeping what felt like a very sustainable pace. The bus had a couple pacers who were blowing whistles and hitting tambourines and it was a nice confidence boost to hear them slowly fade into the distance behind us. Crowd support throughout was amazing, loads of signs and music along the way. Although the water tables were abundant, they got quite crowded. Fortunately, because we were carrying our own water we could occasionally just skip the super busy tables and just keep taking water as needed in-between. \n\nAt around 27km we re-entered",
        "r, everybody was in great spirits, there were no injuries or significant bonking. A very nice overall experience. We had 2 debutants who did very well and liked the race, so maybe they will do it again next year :) We did have about 3 hours of torrential rain and strong winds from about midnight, which was a bit brutal, but that is usually a part of the package. The start and finish was in quite hot, brilliant sunshine.\nI did 5 laps. The first lap (about 9km long) started with a hill, then a quite long descent, I felt really good and had a pretty fast pace. The second (10.5 km lap) was uneventful, a bit of side stitch - which I don't really understand, I haven't had them for years. I was the lucky one to get the worst of the storm in my third lap (about 7.5 km), so that was not too much",

Managed to cheer them both across the line, got another pint and hobbled slowly back to the car.\n\nI was back at work the following day, and despite a bit of DOMS and a reasonable sized blister, I seem to be recovering OK - I found out at the end of the day that my colleagues were taking bets on how long until I flaked out on them. I didn't find this out until I offered to lock up, losing everyone the bet!\n\nOverall, I think I could have finished much stronger if I'd kept my pace in check at the start, and I also think the heat played a big role towards the end.",
        "s. I stayed atmy sisters the night before and then travelled by train on the day. The race was to start at 7:30 PM which was really oddas I usually run in the mornings. We set off to get the train which my sister thought was a 15m walk, it actually was about 45m including running up a hill to make sure we made the train, which we did by about 60s. We get to Kendal, theres no Taxi's available for 45m so we get to the venue at about 6:50 or so. Go in, register etc, then comes the first bad news. I hear mutterings about hills but pay no attention, a lady walks up and says \"Sorry but its against road racing regulations to wear headphones\" - f**k. I always run with headphones, what hope do I have without music and how will I hear my splits?! Oh well, not much I can do about it I guess.   We",
        "without chasing someone. I was really maxing out my lungs by this point and reviewing my Garmin/Strava afterwards, I was pushing HR zone 4 for 91% of the race. I tapered off after that point, beating myself up for going too hard too early. I really battled to keep under 5min/km pace then for the remainder of the flats and hills after that point, pushing hard on the downhills to make the time back (my preferred style from all the hilly trails I'm used to running). When i finally saw that \"400m to go\" sign, I pushed hard and attempted a sprint to get over the finish line under 48 mins. I passed the line at something like 48:01, but chip time came out at 47:53. Well happy with that.\n\n### Post-race\n\nAbsolutely fine.

My brother has run sub 3:40 marathons before. We ate lots of pasta and tried to get a sleep. Unfortunately it was pretty damn hot but I got 6 hours of sleep. After several buses we made it to the starting area, with me being at a different starting point from my brother and girlfriend. They started 15 minutes prior so I knew there was no hope of seeing them. \n\n### Race\nDon't start too fast. Don't start too fast. It's hot.

In the end I was able to cross the finish line looking strong and uninjured with 3:06:59 on the clock, 3:03:48 net time.\n\n### Post-race\nSomehow the moment I stopped running the sun suddenly felt a lot hotter. I wanted to collapse but had to keep walking until I got into the botanical gardens where I found some shade, collecting a bottle of water, a medal and a finisher shirt on my way through. Trying to find my friends was surprisingly difficult and if given the opportunity to provide feedback, I\u2019d suggest the organisers create some kind of designated post-run meetup point with shade and chairs. A friend was staying in a hotel nearby and very kindly let me use their shower to freshen up before we all went to a woodfire pizza joint",
        "my intended pace. Being mainly an East-West route there was very little shade offered by the trees and hedges. By 6k it was becoming more important just to finish without stopping rather than trying to get a faster time. A sub-50 target became sub-52, and the drink I picked up at 6k went half down my throat and half over my head.\n\nI kept on going, sticking with a small group who also seemed to be struggling with the heat. The next couple of rural kilometers ticked by gently until we were back onto the business park for the final 1.5km. I was up to a 5:30/km pace but wasn't really concerned about a quick time by this point. I picked up a bit of speed in the home stretch but it wasn't quite enough to get me under 52 minutes.\n\n### Post-race\nI shambled over to the end of the funnel to pick",

I saw some of my race buddies from earlier about 150m ahead of me so concentrated on what I would tell them when I caught up with them (\"OMG you guys, I'm back!\"). That kept me distracted for another 5k at which point we were on a decline and it was a lot easier running.\n\nThe halfway point arrived and it was great to join the half-marathon racers on their route. I'd been running solo for most of the previous 5k and it really tired me out. Having some slower moving people to overtake was a great confidence boost. Plus my actual (read: not race buddy) friends/girlfriend were running the half so I was keen to try and catch up with them. At this point, I had a feeling I was making pretty good time.

Been training for about 4 weeks and just ran 10.85k for a charity event and matched my target time exactly. We had heavy rain just before the event, so most of the course (1,55km laps) was muddy and as if climbing a steep hill 7 times wasn't enough, it was extremely slippery. Running through the mud with like minded people was really fun and I definitely fell back in love with running. I'm feeling confident for getting a sub 60 min 10k on a flatter course soon.

This test involves running on a treadmill that gradually gets faster until you can no longer keep up. While running you breath through a mask which is to a machine which records how much oxygen you inhale, how much carbon dioxide you exhale and other things. Ask for a test protocol that keeps the incline at 1% and just increases the treadmill speed.\n\nHere's [a video of me 25 minutes into a V02 max test](https://youtu.be/mYvtvAkULm4).

Due to my schedule and the soon to be oppressive heat and humidity of Texas, I generally run in the early morning hours.  These two things combined can provide for some nice scenery when I'm out and about.  I regularly come across deer, rabbits, squirrels, and armadillos, and sooo many types of birds.\n\nI've also come across less wholesome wildlife, too, though.  I was once chased by a pissed off skunk for about 400 yards (personal best pace for me!), I've scared many a mother opossum with her litter.  Their hissing is the stuff of nightmares if you don't know where it's coming",

The more I read the more I discovered that these ultra-marathons are a completely different beast and not simply a longer marathon.  You'll find most distances beyond the marathon tend to be trail runs.  And most of these trail runs have countless hills, on narrow trails with uneven footing.

That's why it can go away on its own just by stopping running. The problem, as I understand it, is that running has a tendency to build the muscles in a way that can cause the uneven movement of the patella and, therefore, the rubbing and pain. (Additionally, for women, we've got wider pelvis creating a slightly different muscle angle that also increases the likelihood of the uneven movement.) So it can go away",

You may argue that optical readers can also do that, but the problem is that\u2014as I noted above\u2014optical readers are far more likely to give false positives.

The Garmins do give much more reliable readings, but still are inferior to chest straps.\n\nBut I want to be clear: the optical readers are not \"worthless,\" rather, they are useful for a casual runner who just wants a general idea of his runs.

So I choose comfort over accuracy down to the beat happily, each and every day.\n\nTLDR = unless you're a pro level athlete, wear what's comfy to you and choose comfort over 100% accuracy.

        "my rest days which worked out nicely as I could spend more time with my family.\n\n### Pre-race\nI had taken my usual rest day on Saturday and instead played golf with my family who came into town for this race. It was a great way to walk a bit before the race without getting my legs too tired. Got up early for the 8am race around 5am and had my black coffee, two scrambled eggs, toast and a banana. I struggle with eating before I run as I usually get that stitches feeling but thankfully I ate early enough to digest it all and be ready this time. When I signed up for the race I had to put my seed time down which I did at 1:25 thinking I might be able to get a slightly better corral. Unfortunately. this year I once again got stuck in the last corral. If you haven't done the boilermaker before",
        "up at 3 a.m. to do my routine of getting my last carb load in of some Tailwind and a couple of slices of bread and some massage gun work on my calves. My throat was still bothering me and I was still dealing with the congestion. I figured at that point that I was going to at least try and run this race since I trained up for it.\n\nGot to the race around 5:30, and did the usual routine of going to the porta potties, warming up, and stretching while having some conversations with people around me.\n\nThen it was time to line up and then get the race going.\n\n# Race\n\nThe start of the race was a little chilly since there was cloud cover. I knew it was going to be hot because it was supposed to be in the 70s by 8 o'clock according to the forecast. Being that this is my third go-around on this, I",

No worries, I had some time built into my schedule to boil half a dozen eggs. This is why it's good to not get too frazzled - just go with the flow. So after the shower, I set some eggs to boil while I got ready and packed my lunch.\n\n**Running Gear:**  \nI wore black pants, a yellow shirt with a collar, and a blue sweater over that shirt. All cotton, of course. My pants were covered in lint, so I got my sticky roller thing to get all that off, since I have a meeting with one of the VPs at the end of today's race. Ordinarily, I don't care about lint, but this is race day, people!\n\n**Starting line:**  \nI arrived at 7:45, and hit the break room",

I don\u2019t normally eat breakfast of any kind, but I had about half a blueberry bagel and a small amount of water. I sat in my car and listened to music for about a half hour before moseying over to the starting area a few minutes before my family arrived. I was able to use the restroom one more time in a real bathroom in the adjacent city park before the race began. The weather was good, with temperatures in the mid-50s in the morning. This was a little warmer and more humid than I wanted, but much better than the forecast of rain that had been threatening race day for over a week. I was happy and",
        "er, each 2 weeks apart. I set PRs in each.\n\n### Pre-race\nI woke up at 5 am to get dressed and eat breakfast. Rain--heavy at times--was forecast for at least part of the race so I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to wear the night before. I ultimately went with a Nike Dri-Fit short sleeve shirt underneath a Nike Dri-Fit long sleeve shirt that isn't too heavy, along with shorts, compression socks, and (of course) my shoes. I figured that if it did rain hard, it didn't really matter what I wore, to some extent.\n\nI made a mistake (for which I would later pay) with breakfast. I decided against eating to packets of oatmeal and a banana because I was worried it would be too much. Instead, I went with one packet of oatmeal, a banana, and a protein bar. I waited around my house for a",

I took the next few days off (not sure if this was smart to do- open to suggestions though).\n\n# Race strategy\n\nI remember my professor (an avid runner/iron man/triathlete at age 60+) telling me to start out slow and pick up the pace later in the race- so I kept that in mind. He actually shot me a good luck email before the race to start out slow and finish strong! Wicked nice of him to do that :)\n\n# Pre-race\n\nWoke up, ate a nice meal. (Two tortillas, rice, and eggs). I would plan to use the GU as directed 5min before, and every 45min, so that's what I did. I have to disclose, THE WEATHER WAS MISERABLE. It was rainy, and 38-40 degrees out. But hey, I ran a practice run in the rain just to mentally prepare myself, just in case, so I was good. It was just so so cold.\n\n# Miles [1] to",

Had a cup of black coffee and 2 packets of my kids oatmeal -- went with maple syrup and brown sugar flavor. Also had a piece of toast with peanut butter with a cup of water.\n\nBy 630a I got to the track and jogged a mile in an insulated jacket and tights to keep warm. No stretching. Ran two 400s at close to 6:15 pace with a one lap recovery jog between the reps. By then I was feeling pretty good and decided to swap out shoes and shed the jacket and pants.\n\nAfter a few light strides I got the show on the road at exactly 7:35. Quite a bit delayed as I was trying to setup a camera to film the TT.\n\n# Race\n\nMile 1 / 2: got out",

I sent him a few texts of where to meet after the race, and passive-aggressively signed him up for text alerts of my pace, one of which I hoped would wake him up. I Ubered over to the start area, arriving around 6:15 for a 7:00 start. Luckily, ATC had an in-training tent set up with bins for our stuff, so I didn't have to deal with long gear check lines or anything. \n\nThe temperature was the most surprising part. For the previous two or three weeks, Atlanta has been getting into the 70s and 80s, but race day was projected to be a high of 57, with temps in the low 40s at the start of the race. I had planned on wearing a short-sleeved tech shirt and shorts, so I stuck with that, even though I was slightly",

The building is huge, and half of it is a hotel...so the lobby is open and makes a great place to hang out pre-race.  I got downtown very early (I hate being rushed pre-race), parked in the garage I used to use when I worked there, and headed to the hotel lobby to wait for a couple friends.  I just chilled out on a couch in the lobby until they got there.  One of my friends and I occasionally train together too, our fitness levels are close enough that it works pretty well to share long runs when we have the time to get together.  Once the whole group had taken advantage of indoor plumbing, we headed out and found our",

Normally about the time I'm stumbling in from the bar on a Saturday night, so nothing new ;) I ate breakfast, took a long shower, got dressed - and it was 4:45. I started kicking myself for not getting an extra hour of sleep, as I didn't need to leave for an hour yet. I spent the next hour pacing around my apartment praying that my digestive system and/or ankle wouldn't bless we with another DNF, drinking water, stretching, and internally debating/adjusting the order of the songs on my race playlist.\nI caught at Uber at 6AM and was at the start area by 6:15, leaving 45 minutes to spare. I definitely wasn't used to getting to a race when it's still completely dark; but I was starting to feel more"

You run slowly and relaxed with zero pressure on yourself to run faster. \n\nOnce you get into W7, that can be a reasonable time to start tracking. From then on you are running single runs, and the time is increasing only a little at a time. I started with a running app, tracking so I knew how far I\u2019d run. My goal was 5k. I plotted a slow increase in distance for my successive runs so that at the end I was running 5k distance. Slowly increasing distance over the last 2-3 weeks of the",
        "psych myself up to do the 25-28-30 minute stretches. I also was going so slow at times that I felt I could walk faster, which feels weird but is common advice. I think pace is something that takes more time to build on so just keep at it. Everyone is different and coming at this with different bodies/fitness levels. I don't compare myself to others and Ive read the key is continuing to run slow and run further as you progress.\n\nBy the end of c25k (this past Tuesday) my running time was roughly 2 miles (I was not counting my walking warm up or cool down). However on Thursday I did the first day of a 5 to 10k program which increased the running interval by ten mins and I was able to hit the 5k distance in the first workout, which was 4x10 min runs with a one minute walk between each run",
        "y right. Usually your time goes down over the beginning of the program because you were originally faster than you could sustain and now you're finding your comfy pace. Stick to a conversational pace and increase distance. I'm still far from fast, but my first 5k eight months ago after c25k was 39 minutes, and I was down to 34 during a normal run (not racing) last week, so it really does naturally happen.",
        "about building endurance. If you can keep your heart rate steady and run continuously- you are doing it right.  Time and consistency, along with introducing hills, and different intervals- will help improve your speed. \n\nBe patient with your body. Listen to it. Take breaks when needed through this journey. I\u2019m going to guess that by the end of the 8 weeks, you\u2019ll be somewhere in the 6:20-6:55 min/km.\n[u/highdon (3 pts)]: Never ever worry about how fast you're going during your C25K, especially not in your first week. This programme is about building your stamina and getting you used to running. The aim is to get you to run 30 minutes at the end with no mention of distance or pace. Yes, 5K is in the name but if you listen to your coach/app/whatever it is you're following, you will notice",
        "en doing a 5k program because the distance keeps on increasing\n However if you go back a few weeks and do an old run you could probably go faster. I did a 10 k program once and my speed increases a little at the end but not by much on the longer distances. \n\nI have to have music or podcasts going for most of runs. I've used treadmills before but that was in an apartment complex mini gym and there was a TV to watch.\n[u/FlatZookeepergame392 (5 pts)]: You are adapting to a new exercise , slow and steady and being consistent  are the key, pace will come once you have completed the programme\n[u/zerojinx (3 pts)]: When it comes to C25K, speed doesn't matter.  Doing the program while trying to run faster is like trying to build a house while learning how to use the tools you have.\n\nWhat matters"

What type of program or schedule can I do now? I want to maintain my endurance (and weight loss I have achieved during the program) but 60 mins of running 3x a week might be harder to maintain with school starting for my kids (virtually might I add) and my busy season at work.

I recently signed up for a race with some friends, hence the training, but I'll probably drop my milage afterwards.\n\nI only bring this up because you don't have to transition to a 10k program to progress as a runner.

What would give you the greatest sense of satisfaction and achievement? How does running fit into your fitness goals in general?\n\nIn general though, it's a good idea to spend a few weeks running a 5k three times a week to let your body finish adapting. \n\nAlternatively you could work on the transition to outdoor running, by going back to the week of the C25k program that you feel comfortable running"

Running your figures through a bmi calculator, you're 10lbs above the lower end of the healthy band. 20lbs would leave you unhealthily underweight.\nAlso bear in mind that muscle is a lot heavier than fat, so the  running and strength training that gives you better condition won't lead to weight loss unless you've got a lot of excess to begin with (you don't!).

I'm sure it does - but itself also depends on many factors like current weight, composition, etc. On top of this, it's been shown that carb-loading e.g. before a marathon will obviously increase your weight due to the carbs & water being stored in your muscle, but that the improved performance from having a good carb resource completely offsets any 'negative' effect of the extra weight.\n\nI once read that the perfect racing weight is the one at which you've performed your best (where your PRs might be, that is).

My most recent 5k, I got a time of 22:55 but would really like to try aiming for a time under 20 minutes before I go to university. I usually do a 3k, 2-3 times a week and a 5k as well on the weekends. I'm just trying to get an idea of how feasible it would be if I tried to run 5-6 times a week and maybe try increase the distance & pace.\n[u/TRJF (102 pts)]: My impression: very possible, because right now your mileage is quite low for making progress.

I don't normally train for speed and average around 30km per week doing 5-10k runs at around a 5:40 km pace fairly easily.  \n\n\nIf you were attempting a similar challenge what would the next 60 days look like for you?  \n\n\nFeel free to",

I would say yes you can do it but it generally requires some decent dedication. Also don\u2019t focus on trying to better your 5k time every week as this will likely bring disappointment and not be that productive. Make sure your plan includes a long run (in this case 10k+) also some speed work as well, I\u2019m a huge fan of well placed speed work in a plan, 400\u2019s 800\u2019s are going to be your friend.

My pace at the beginning of the year was landing me at around 22 minutes most runs.  There were two things that helped me get faster quickly. The first was cross-training on an exercise bike. The bike helped me to up the volume of my aerobic training but the low-impact kept my injury-risk low. The second was including very deliberate speed work into my weekly running routine. This came in the form of running 800s on the treadmill. I found that running 800s really helped increase the top speed that felt natural for me.\n    [u/WhatWouldKimiDo (5",

For context, I'm a 31F that has been running for 4-5 years, more seriously in the last 2 years. Currently I run around 35-40 miles per week, no real structure apart from one long run of 13 miles or more. I play a team sport twice a week and strength train once or twice.

Around the same time, I also started reading about training and I've incorporated the long runs, 800m intervals, easy runs, etc into my routine. We'll see how I do next month. So far my endurance base has increased dramatically and I stopped tracking or simulating a 5k distance with 5k race effort (except during intervals which is slightly faster than 5k pace). My first \"long\" run in Nov was 50 mins for about 5.2 miles, and now that pace and distance became my \"easy\" run as I have improved. I've been doing mostly at 8:30 paces during training and my last long runs were all 8-10 miles.\n\nMy question for you all is how long do you think it'll take for me to get to 21:00 5K and/or 6 min mile?

        "huge (for me) ramp up in running volume. \n\nOne thing that I found that built a lot of confidence in my running speed was progression runs. My coach (aka, my runner friend who does about 4 marathons a year) drew up a plan, which included progression runs once a week. I found that these built a lot of confidence in my ability to maintain speed, it was during these progression runs that I managed a 25:45 5k time and a 53:52 10k time. I actually managed to hit 20k twice during my running, albeit at slower paces, and they felt *hard*. The only time I managed any significant distance at my goal HM pace was 16km. So I definitely had some nerves going into Sunday. \n\nMy lifting, I did a program called Simple Jack'd, by u/DadliftsnRuns, who I look up to both as a lifter and a runner. \n\n* Monday -",

I took a few days off in the beginning of July, which caused me to miss one 10 mile run. Then in August I had to travel a bunch for work, so I had to move 2-3 runs around but still tried to complete them. All of the workouts were heart rate based, and I should have started my training by doing a lactate threshold test. \n\nI averaged 25-30 miles per week. Looking back, I had plenty of long runs where I finished, looked back at the week, and felt like I could have done more. But I avoided any injuries, and I don't think I even came",
        "ards fixing, training went really really well! I am very lucky to avoided injury, but aside from luck, I have my amazing amazing coach Jim Finlayson to thank. I haven\u2019t worked with a coach since high school but I am so so glad that I did decide to (and was accepted on to his roster of athletes, despite not being anywhere close to fast and/or elite). Very grateful for that not only to get structure to weekly workout plans but also general feedback/motivation as well as constant revising and rethinking in response to how things were going week-to-week: what was working, what wasn\u2019t. \n\n\n\nGenerally my training was about 12-ish weeks long, ramping up from about 15-20 miles per week to about 35 miles weekly by the end. As much as possible of this was done on trails or hilly areas but this was",

Overall, compared to most marathon plans, I would say my mileage per week was on the lower end, but I made sure to hit all of the key sessions with intent to get the most out of them. I would say my higher peak volume was only 50 miles. \n\nThe only real issue that came up was around 6 weeks out from race day, I had a minor overuse injury on my right quad. I could barely put any weight on it. Thankfully it wasn't a strain or anything and I just took 2 weeks off completely from running. I was able to still cycle and swim to keep the body moving and I knew that I wouldn't drop run fitness that quickly. \n\n### Pre-race\n\nI started my taper 2 weeks out and once I got over my",

I only missed 3 runs over the 12 weeks, which is a huge win in my book. I didn't do much else, other than keeping active and some yoga. I think next time I will try to keep more weight training rather than dropping it like I did this time. My longest run was 11 miles, and I did it in some crazy heat. I had to stop every mile or so for water, and it brought my confidence down a bit. The only reason I got through that run was because my dad biked next to me the entire time (a homie) and was a rockstar with the waters. The last two weeks I have been tapering. This was very hard because it made me feel like I",
        "e/stamina in regards to GA/ML/long runs.  I really wish I could have hit the interval workouts as scheduled.  Hopefully, the next time I try a plan with this sort of mileage, my body will adapt a bit quicker to allow for the speed work too.  One trouble I found was that 18 weeks at a large volume really got to be  grind.  I think I came very close to overtraining.  Some days were just a mental struggle to out and get the miles.  I think for my next marathon cycle I may try a 12-week program to help with that.  I certainly needed the 18 weeks in this case to give a gentle build to peak.\n\n*NOTE:  I wrote all of the above before race day so that the race (good or bad) wouldn't influence my training writeup.*\n\n___\n**Race Choice**\n\nI\u2019d originally hoped to run the Wicked Marathon (my first",

This time I decided to use Pfitz\u2019s 18/85 marathon plan as a mileage framework and adapt it for my race.  I wanted a heavy volume focus and wanted to worry less about speed work.  I moved the MLR from midweek to Saturday before my long run to get a larger chunk of miles back-to-back.  Typically these were 15 mi/ 20 mi blocks on the weekend.  I kept the Saturday runs around 15 miles each week and the long runs in the 20-22 mile range.\n\nFor workouts, I alternated tempo runs and hill repeats.  Tempos, I opted for Daniels\u2019 approach of tempo",
        "I was absolutely terrified that I wouldn't make it to the starting line healthy, but taking a rest day in addition to a cross-training day every week seemed to help. I hovered around 40 mi/week for most of the 16-week plan, peaking at 50 miles and doing 3 separate 20-mile long runs over the course of the plan (wanted to do a 22-miler but cut it short because of some lingering pain). Oddly enough my first 20-miler felt the best, doing it at sub 7:30 pace and even having a random 6:30 mile in there, and after that I thought huh, maybe I could go for a BQ. I know I should've had a more conservative goal, but I was too tempted to compare myself to my more experienced and faster friends. The subsequent long runs felt worse but I attributed it to fatigue and warming weather and powered through",
        "d by a former Olympic runner. They wrote me a plan that I followed pretty closely and put on two mid-week track sessions and a Saturday long run every week, which was extremely helpful. Additionally, I did one or two mid-week runs on my own, usually between 7-10 miles, and a day of cross training (I liked boxing but I mixed it up week to week). It was considerably more enjoyable training with a group, especially when the mileage on the long runs was getting high. Outside of a two week European vacation this summer and a Labor Day weekend trip, I was averaging mid-30s mpw and my longest two runs were 20 and 23. I ran an encouraging 10 mile race in late September at a 7:10 average pace and felt like I had plenty left in the tank, so I was feeling good about my fitness heading into this"

Essentially: whether drinking water or sports drink, if you over-drink (i.e. completely replace your sweat losses), you will end up with lower electrolyte concentrations.

We were so overwhelmed by all the feedback last time we went ahead and recorded another episode. I spent this episode chasing Nigel around the studio and I'm pretty sure neither of us died.\nThis episode is about cardiac health and running. Every six months or so, headlines proclaiming the doom of people who like to run seem to pop up like little schadenfreude sundaes. People love to tell runners that all their hard work is likely causing more harm than good, and after the deaths of celebrities like Jim Fixx, Micah True, and even poor old Pheidippides (he of Marathon fame), it is a little scary to contemplate.",
        "so back to the base of people with bad heart conditions in endurance events? would it be that for everyone who does a long distance ironman or 100 mile running race are doing more harm to themselves vs anything good? should we all avoid these type of feats? or just doing such things in moderation still key?",
        "arathoner named Paul Thompson, M.D., was running Bay to Breakers 12K when one such death occurred. The tragedy sparked a lifelong and career-defining interest for Thompson, who is now the co-physician-in-chief of the Hartford Health-Care Heart and Vascular Institute and perhaps the world\u2019s leading authority on the cardiac consequences of running. In 1979, Thompson published a report on 18 men and women who died during or immediately after running, 13 of whom had heart disease. \u201cSuperior physical fitness does not guarantee protection against exercise deaths,\u201d he and his coauthors warned.\n\nSuch deaths were rare in the 1970s partly because running as a mass-participation sport was new: There were only 16,233 marathon finishers in the U.S. in 1975. Four decades later, in 2015, there were more",

If you do that, is you have no outstanding heart issues i don't see why you couldn't run as much as you want.\n[u/indiedotkim (6 pts)]: I think you're taking the wrong approach, because the risk of dying during a marathon is already extremely low -- it just makes for good headlines and people can feel good about themselves that they don't exercise.\n\nIn comparison to the death rate of the general population, you're far more likely to go out due to: diabetes, a traffic accident, or an STI (excl. HIV/AIDS)... and you don't stop having sex now, right?",
        ", might lead to atrial fibrillation, in which your regular heartbeat is replaced by rapid and irregular beating. And the turbulent flow of blood through your coronary arteries during running might contribute to the formation of artery-clogging plaques, raising the risk of a heart attack (a blockage of bloodflow to the heart that can, in turn, lead to sudden cardiac arrest, in which your heart stops completely).\n\nAll of this means\u2014in theory, at least\u2014that dedicated long-term runners should be less healthy and long-lived than their more casual peers. It\u2019s only now, four decades after the first running boom, that we finally have large numbers of men and women entering their retirement years having run for most of their adult lives. And their mortality statistics reveal that\u2014well,"

As I am beginning to show now, HRT brings transgender women's performance capacity closer to that of females. The most important part is that **the effects of HRT on individuals vary widely and are strongly dependent on when you start HRT.** For example, starting HRT at 20 years old, I have a very good chance of widening hip bones. The rest of my skeletal structure is not going to be affected. Someone who started at 14, however, will have most if not all skeletal features of a female as they developed with estrogen.

I was an absolute beginner who never thought I could run for 5 min at a time. I recently found out that I have to have a minor procedure tomorrow where a catheter will be played internally for a few weeks time, so  I'm not sure how that will affect my routine.

After a month or so when your joints are used to walking long distances, start short jogs. 1 min jog 1 min walk. Repeat for 30 mins.

A lot of people think that cardio will help them lose a bunch of weight but really, it's diet changes that will be the biggest factor in weight loss. Running will help endurance and your cardiovascular system but you'll only burn meaningful amounts of calories at a more advanced level of workouts that aren't possible for people that aren't yet fit. Being overweight and running also puts extra stress on your joints and can result in injury. Instead I'd recommend exercise with less impact like swimming or cycling until you're closer to a healthy weight range.  \n  \nIf you want to try it anyway, don't deviate from the program at all."

Running is pretty much the only sport where you bang all of the small bones and tendons in your feet into a hard surface over and over again, thousands of times at almost exactly the same angle, so if they're not used to that, it can mess you up.

I just went 4:05 to 3:30 at Chicago but this feels more impressive.\n\nI agree that upping the mileage def helps. Which plan did you follow?

Training went reasonably well, I almost always had some kind of niggle but nothing that lasted more than a few days and I only missed 1 run in the first 13 weeks. I hit all the paces without too much trouble but in hindsight probably pushed too hard considering I've only been running around 18 months and this was my first marathon and first time at this high mileage.\n\nI did a solo 15km time trial in week 12 in 59:37 and 29km with 23km at goal MP pace the following week, and I was starting to"

I'm still to do my 5k (next weekend - eek!), but my mile and 2 mile time trials have been a LOT faster than they've been in a long time.\n\nI just wanted to give my two cents and let you know that if you walk/run, it's not cheating or making you any less of a 'real' runner - and in some instances it can make you a better runner! I know it's not for everyone, but people do give walk/run a hard time.

I'm not sure what google maps assumes for where you run on the road (center/left/right) or what you do around corners.

If you import your data into Strava or similar you can use Strava to calculate the correct distance from the GPS route rather than the distance Fitbit sends it.  From what I've read the GPS is only used to create the map on the Fitbit, not work out the distance.  It seems a lot of people have been checking their distances and found them way off to varying degrees \n\n I've noticed some of my runs which show up as 5Km on Fitbit app showing up less on Strava (and some slightly more) so not sure whats going on\n\nFortunately I treated myself to a Garmin Vivoactive 3M since which seems to be spot on so definitely running 5km+ now\n\nAnyway"

I'm running a half marathon next week and through out my years of training, I've determined that my performance is definitely better when I do some sort of run-walk-run rather than continuous running. \n\nMy question is what strategies work for you for races?  I've done 10 min run 1 min walk, and in my training I've definitely taken more or longer walk breaks than I would want for a race. Just curious to see what other people do. More or longer walk breaks at the beginning? Consistent throughout?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks\n[u/trtsmb (4 pts)]: Check out Jeff Galloway. He's the master of the run/walk strategy.\n[u/LilJourney (3",
        "on, experiment and find something that works better for you.\n\nI've been running for decades. If I run slow (9 mpm) I can go literally for hours. It takes a lot of years to get to that point but that's what running is about IMHO.\n\nAlways remember that your body can go farther than is good for it. It is very easy to give yourself an overuse injury by running too much too soon. I still give myself niggles by ramping up my training too fast.\n  [u/xixi2 (5 pts)]: > Run/walk is a good way to get started.\n\nThe most experienced marathoner I know runs 3:20s using the Galloway Method. So it works for a range of people https://www.runtothefinish.com/galloway-method-run-walk-marathon/\n\nI personally don't understand it but I probably haven't given it a real chance either\n    [u/Maskedrussian (3 pts)]:",

I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to run the entire race for any of them and I needed to make sure I could recover as fast as possible, so I used a run-walk strategy.\n\nRun 1 mile, then walk 2-3 minutes, and repeat until finish. It worked really well for me. I set up a custom workout on my watch to beep automatically for me when it was time to change intervals.\n\n[Here is one source with some good run-walk information.](http://www.jeffgalloway.com/training/run-walk/)\n[u/Packtex60 (120 pts)]: Remember, slow, stubborn, and stupid is a powerful combination for distance runners. \ud83d\ude00\n  [u/telmereth1986 (7 pts)]: Now you're speaking",

I think it worked pretty well both in training and on the day, felt like it reduced the stress on my body of each run and allowed me to run further/for longer than I otherwise would have been able to.\n[u/udelkitty (6 pts)]: I used it for my second half marathon, 3:1 run walk ratio.

Pelvic floor PT will help you so much. I would drop down to the half and plan for a fall marathon.

I have no clue\n[u/Fjandalos (8 pts)]: Hey there, quite nice to find someone like me ^^\u2019 I\u2019m currently at 120kg, 187cm. Started at 135kg about 4 months ago. Keep going :)\n\nI\u2019d rather recommend a watch, as it\u2019s easier to control your vitals and you won\u2019t need your smartphone. After all I guess it\u2019s a personal thing though. Usually I try to leave everything at home I don\u2019t need while running to focus on nothing but the track.\n\nHow\u2019d you get into Triathlons? Just talked about them with my running buddy yesterday.\n\nEdit: For \u201cserious\u201d running (i\u2019d definitely include Trias) it\u2019s highly benificial to get your HR and min/km quite exact - even in training. Most training to improve your distance includes faster and slower parts, usually",
        "the capture of the entire running gait and improves distance and pace accuracy.\n\nMy goal of this post is to simplify the practicality of training with a running power meter and why adding in a simple tool can improve the planning, racing, and analysis of your running.  Full disclosure: I work at a company called Stryd that makes a running power meter. This is no way an advertisement, rather an informational post on the concept of training with power.\n\n_______________\n\n\nTo start things off I'm going to answer some questions that some other ARTC people asked the other day:\n\n\n> **I think I push too hard on uphills. I assume a power meter could help me with this?**\n\nYes. When you run up a hill during a race (especially) or normal training run your effort will increase instantly while your",
        "ake a difference.\n\nA number of the things I've read regarding 80/20 training has led me to buying a Stryd footpod, but I can't say that I'm really enamored with it so far (after only 3 weeks). \n\nUsing the power calculators, I've been staying in the correct zones for the training plans, but it's very odd. I'm reading slower paces than I used to with just HR zone training, my HR is higher on average, and I just don't quite \"get\" it, even after all of my research. \n\nWhat am I missing here? Anyone else training by power alone? Is it just not for everyone? I'm not really racing competitively, so is it something that is above my level right now?\n[u/phytness (6 pts)]: It\u2019s probably above your level tbh, if it\u2019s your first marathon and you\u2019re not aiming for a decent time then the most important",
        "it's not going to be as good as a stryd anyway but it may be a bit better than GPS yeah, if you need immediate feedback on your pace imho if you only use power, you will still miss out you keep XXX watts on your threshold intervals, but HR keeps increasing.. you haven't done a threshold workout but a harder one",
        "g all my runs, and combine with the HRM-Run strap. As the power metric for running is new, there's no direct support for the metric under the 'running app' so you need to set it up in a riding profile. This isn't too big of an issue unless you also rely on connect for your cycling data (which I do). \nAs it is now incorporated into the HRM strap, you can either get Garmin or the Power metric, not both. \nIt will be interesting to see if Garmin will allow it's input directly into the running profile as a data screen, I know you can use connect IQ to see the power data while running, but it doesn't record it. As I'm more of an 'after the fact' assessor of my data, I see this as a limitation. \nAfter Jan next year I'm going to give one of the power specific training plans a go. I can say that",
        "Literally wrong straight away \ud83d\ude02 That was before I even found out if its just an ad for Stryd (which isnt very good) > The higher the watts, the more oomph produced with every step and the better your running economy. https://tenor.com/view/dog-huh-what-say-get-gif-26522058 > While studies show that watts may not be a useful tool for the elite runners out there, preliminary research says it may be useful for anyone who\u2019s trying to run their first marathon or hit a 5K PR. First, what studies?",
        "e there are rolling hills everywhere which makes pace a flawed metric to follow. I used to use heart rate to make sure I didn't overdo it on easy runs, which is a decent way to go. Now I use a Stryd footpod and run by power zones. I find this to be much more effective. Heart rate can be frustrating because I have found it to be difficult to keep it low during easy runs, and also difficult to raise higher for intensity intervals. A running power meter reacts very quickly. I set it to show me the 3-second average on my watch, and this works well for me. It's crazy how much just a slight incline can raise your effort level. I totally understand the desire to zone out during a run, but if you want the benefits of specified training, glancing at the metrics on your watch every few minutes is",
        "I don't own a Garmin, so I don't know if they calculate a FTP value for you. I know if you own a Stryd pod, it would give you a Critical Power number which is the FTP.",
        "id the math right, my CP went up over 5% from a single race.) But during the race itself, I was running much harder than even my hardest intervals during the past several months of training. The CP is a curve that Stryd generates based on your past performance. What is your highest wattage for 10 seconds? 30 seconds? 1 minute? 10 minutes? 1 hour? It generates a curve based on power vs. time from your recent training. The more recent the training, the more influence it has over your power curve, and thus, influence over your 'official' Critical Power. This single 5k race increased my CP 5%, but that is just one data point on a larger power curve. A curve that still has 'regular' training workouts on it; training based on a CP that was too low, because I never tested myself or trained hard",
        "yeah I guess that's where HR/rpe would come into play; my understanding of power is essentially as GAP+windcorrected (for stryd anyway) pace alternative but that's not really correct, I think but maybe it's a good enough simplification \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af"

I'm hoping to get it 40+ miles over the next few months.\n\n**What time of day do you prefer to run?** \n\n>Early morning before work, but that never works out for me so I'm stuck with late afternoon/evening runs. Currently I like to run anytime I'm not going to melt into the sidewalk.\n\n**Any big races coming up?** \n\n> If you know me then you know I love races. I've got 10 races scheduled up until 4/29/2017 (it was so cheap on Global Running Day!), but my big races are:\n\n> Backyard Classic 8 Hour Ultra in August - I want to see how far I can go",

It was all very strange, and the embarrassingly large trophy is now quite literally where I hang my hat. Oh, and that race was at my aunt's church, and she cut the announcement about my win from the church bulletin and had it laminated. It's currently hanging on my mirror.\n\n**What time of day do you prefer to run?**\n\n>After work.

We're all going to run it as Reindeer.  \nBut HHH would be the next GOAL race. Probably realistically the 50k. And then a marathon in Seattle as part of a training plan. If I could get that down into the 4 hour region, I'd be happy.\n\n**Are you currently using a training plan? If so, which one?**\n\n>Nope! Just making my way through my own base mileage.

I also believe you get more life out of your shoes because if you are only wearing them one or two times per week as they get close to wearing out, it's not as bad as wearing an older pair on every run. I usually retire mine at 500 miles.\n\nI don't believe you need to give the foam in shoes time to recover. I actually find that laughable.\n  [u/cyaphide (4 pts)]: It is laughable",

That's a big injury risk and an even bigger risk that you aren't going to recover properly, which will continue to affect workouts down the line. That's not how you want your marathon training to go - you're not setting yourself up for success. Your modifications do make sense, but it's worth noting that Pfitz's plans are intended for the user to get through most of it to get the most benefit. You may not run your best marathon possible (but you could still run a great one).\n\nSince you're so early in the plan, have you considered a Daniels or Hanson plan instead? Daniels is more focused on time spent on your feet, and Hanson's plans top out at a 16-mile",

I think I was advised that the Pfitzinger plans are deceptively difficult (as I had been considering the 18/70 plan). If you have taken a look at the program, in week 3, you have a general aerobic run of 10 miles, recovery of 4 miles, LT run of 8 miles, recovery of 4 miles, and a medium long run of 14 miles (not to mention the marathon paced long run the week before), and 2 rest/cross training days. I don't know about you, but I've typically don't have a recovery run as short as 4 miles so you are getting more of a beat down on the other days. \n\nSo since you have 24 weeks until your goal marathon, my suggestion is to build up your base until 18 weeks out and then start the program.\n[u/CBRT (3 pts)]: I did this",

I agree that you need to be ready to put in some serious miles, and maybe Pfitz would be a great place to get weekly mileage goals, but I think that some of the harder workouts as well as the need to get the mileage in over only four days are not necessary per se.\n\nI am with you on and /u/runwichi on the HH novice plans. It really, *really* isn't enough weekly mileage or mid-week mileage in anticipation of the LR. I think there are almost certainly middle-ground plans between HH novice and Pfitz that would be appropriate.\n    [u/katyte25 (5",

I for example like to make spaghetti aglio e olio and then add vegetables such as broccoli and carrots for extra volume without extra carbs. I also like to add in mushrooms for some umami. Or just a simple pasta with pesto. Add some roasted nuts and some mushrooms.\n* Sometimes I'll just buy vegetarian meats at the store and make the same traditional dishes as I've always eaten with real meat, e.g. potatoes with some store-bought vegan schnitzel and some roasted veggies.\n  [u/MeatPopsicle_AMA (21 pts)]: Tofu is the bomb!

So pasta with wilted spinach mixed in with pasta sauce would be an easy solution and a nice dinner if you throw in some \"meat\"balls (gardien makes some nice frozen ones, or you can make your own with TVP).\n\nI personally commonly eat things like cereal/granola (Kashi chocolate Go lean is vegan) in the morning/afternoon with fruit, usually something like roasted vegetables or sweet potatoes with a protein source (beans, tofu, field roast makes a delicious chipotle sausage) and fat (avocado, tahini, nuts, etc) for lunch/dinner, and snacks throughout the day (fruit, pita+hummus, dark chocolate, doughnut because there is a place near my that makes them).

I definitely felt like I made time up on the field in the hills, but I wouldn't underestimate them for anyone looking at this course next year. Some are pretty steep, and miles 14.5 to 17 are pretty much just one steady climb. \n\nAlso, I didn't notice just how much time I was going to spend in the Golden Gate Park. It felt like it dragged on a bit for me, and I found it really refreshing to get back into the city, especially because I'm not from San Francisco.

I told myself that the downhills would use different muscles, so the hilly course was actually GOOD news as I could rest different muscles on the move (oh, the lies we tell ourselves...) Plus I figured that I could always walk more later in the race, but couldn't go back and redo anything if I had a lot in the tank later on.\n\nI started passing a lot of people in this section. For a while I ran alongside a group of ladies in their 40s or 50s, who were just chitchatting and seemed to be having a lovely time as they passed runner after runner on the first huge climb.

        "make my 4:30 goal I summoned the last of my energy and was able to hit that.\n\nCrowd support was great throughout. Thanks for coming out, LA.\n\n## Post-race\n\nAfter the race I hobbled over to the parking structure where my car was-- at this point my legs are done with all this, and that walk felt harder than the last miles of the race. I called my wife to say I finished and she said to take some pictures (I didn't take any pics since my phone stayed in the car). Took some minutes to rest in the car, then went over to the Westfield Century City, a fancy shopping mall, and washed up in the restrooms. Took some photos along Santa Monica Boulevard and the finishers area. Then I went over to the finish festival area where Tai Verdes was supposed to be the highlight-- I know nothing about him, but",
        "etty steep downhill sections, and a long uphill one that was tiresome but since it was towards the beginning it wasn't a race-breaker. There was some good crowd support and the aid stations were all nicely stocked. Passed the 13 mile marker right around 1:28, so I knew my pacing was pretty on point. \n\n### Miles [13] to [26.2]\nRunning through Hollywood and Beverly Hills was really cool, wish I could have taken pictures but settled for looking around at everything. The race ends with a gradual downhill section for the last few miles, so I decided that if I felt good that's where I'd open up my pace, and as luck would have it, I felt great. Closed the race at about a 6:10 pace over the final 4.5 miles (5:40 pace from 40km - finish), and finished with a time of 2:54:21, easily surpassing all",

I feel ready - just trying to shake off some niggling trouble spots left from my injury.\n\nI live in Santa Monica - spotted the electronic signs out yesterday evening on Wilshire, warning about the road closures. That's my cue to get excited! A little run downtown with friends this morning to add to the excitement. (Tried to go see the flower petal alley thing on Broadway... screw that line!)\n[u/New_World_Era (3 pts)]: Yo, over here. I'm completely unprepared haha",
        "That iconic route doesn't include the Santa Monica Pier and a finish at the sea due to a course change in 2021.\n\nEvery single person I talked to + those on the McCourt Foundation staff wants a return to that course with a downhill finish and post race at the beach, but it seems the city of Santa Monica wants to much $$$ for it to happen for now.\n\nThe replacement is a run past the Century City finish line with a loop back 3 miles later from Brentwood back to Century City. It is tortue and I'll walk through in my 21-finish why.\n\n### Race\n**Miles 1-5** \nRunning with a pacer made world's of difference in the start this year vs. last. While last year I both speed too quickly down the initial hills from Dodger Stadium to Downtown this year we kept it measured while dodging the legacy runners"

I immediately signed up for the Space Coast Marathon in November which is a Boston qualifier.\n\nI'm 31 years old, so the Boston qualifying time for my age is under 3 hours.

I usually explain it by saying it's not about running a 5k, but is about building you to the point that you can run several 5ks a week if you want.\n \nPart of building you up involves some muscular development, which will increase your basal metabolic rate.  Which is good.  But muscle is heavy so, despite the development, you will actually see the number INCREASE unless you take action to lose fat, as well.\n \nIt actually is a fantastic way to establish a healthier lifestyle, but as someone else said, it's not a magic bullet.

I'm yet to run a marathon so probably should stop talking though!\n    [u/KingstonFil (3 pts)]: It's not that they say take 1 day off for every mile you race, it's take 1 day of recovery (that includes running easy/walking/cycling).  And typically if you gave it your all on a marathon, it can take up to 6 weeks to be back training 100%.  The Pfizinger 5 week recovery plan is excellent, I've used it and so have many runners I know and it's gotten them all safely back to their training paces/mileage without any injury.\n[u/Darkcharger (5 pts)]: Go low and slow.

        "[Post by u/suasleisaghaidhlig (3 pts)]\nTitle: Recovery after a marathon\nHow long do people take to recover after a marathon?\n\nI'm thinking of running a half, 2 weeks after my first marathon. My goal is very much to finish, and I dont expect to be finishing the marathon in much under 6 hours. 2 hours 30 mins would be a nice time for the half. Last night I did a hilly 16km on trail in 2 hours 10.\n\nOther similar discussions I've seen seem to be focused on people who run really fast, win races, and are aiming for PBs. I am not trying to break any records, I just want to have a nice time. \n\nPresumably people dont lie in bed for several weeks after a marathon...\n[u/HbeforeG (6 pts)]: I usually take a few days before I run again. Part of the enjoyment for the marathon distance for me is how my",

Another thing, I'm 24 so I feel like my body should be able to bounce back after 13 days.. right?\n\nAny advice is greatly appreciated!\n[u/tL1ght (3 pts)]: Last year my marathon was on October 19th, I did my final long run (21 miles) on September 30th. That gave me just over two weeks to recover from that run, and I did really well in my first marathon. Personally I think its plenty of time to recover.",

I've gotten out for a couple of shorter recovery runs this week (~7km) but I'm wondering how soon I can get back into my regular load. I'd like to maintain my level of fitness, and then ideally increase it, but I want to make sure I don't do any damage while my body recovers...  \n\nFor context, I did a slightly increased volume Pfitz 18/55 but was averaging around 80km/week until 2",
        "I was so pissed at the end I immediately signed up for the next race my running club at the time was sending some folks to.\n[u/MothershipConnection (46 pts)]: I've started doing a full week off running after marathons and then taking it pretty easy for the next 2-3 weeks after that before being back at normal volume. Even if the race went well there's still a lot of smaller damage that occurs and I've learned my lesson after straining things when I picked it up again too soon while you should be recovering.\n  [u/cascadingbraces (12 pts)]: I'm relieved to hear this from another fellow runner. Your plan is what I've been doing. A week off after the marathon.

How you feel after that will be a much better indicator for you than listening to other people's experiences.\n  [u/Strawberry_Spice (8 pts)]: That's fair - I'm not normally super depleted after my usual long runs and have actually taken the kids to the park etc after 2/3 halves so it's not like I have a fainting couch on standby. Currently longest run is \\~15 mi but would certainly up that in the next 6 months.

I thought about how cheery my family would be to see me cross the line, and I rehearsed various ways to gracefully find a dark corner to die in.  That wound up eating a good chunk of the final mile, and I was surprised to see the inflatable FINISH balloon dancing ahead of me.  I turned on any amount of gas that I had left, and the trial was over.  I hadn't won. But I had won.\n\n### Post-race\nI didn't find a quiet corner to die in; In fact once I caught my breath I was ecstatic that my sibling had had such an excellent first half experience!  I wound up beating my adult best half marathon time by a few seconds,",

On one hand I told everyone that I wanted to get at least one mile under a 7:00 pace to say that I did it, but I didn't exactly want it to be the first mile.\n\nMile three was where the uphills started coming in and it slowed me down just a bit. I knocked out the first 5K in 21:45 which was a good deal faster than I intended. I chalked it up to the downhills and being excited, but tried to make a conscious effort from there on out to not spend too much energy early on.\n\nI tried to focus on the crowds whenever possible. I loved going out of my way to high-five the little kids. I found myself in really high spirits",
        "ace came up to high five me and congratulate me on doing a good job. Maybe he finished right behind me and was trying to catch me and couldn't? Maybe he finished way ahead of me and saw me finish strong? Idk but thanks man. That guy who said \"shit!\" when I passed him came up and asked if I hit my goal of sub 1:40 and I was stoked to tell him yes and he congratulated me also. Man the running community is full of badass people. Such good vibes post-race. As I grabbed some fruit and sat down to watch others finish. It was being announced that the woman crossing the finish had just broken a world record for the marathon while pushing a baby in a stroller! She finished in 3:03! How amazing. I was super impressed.

It took a good half mile before it started to quiet down. \n\nMiles 1-3 and no coughing so I picked up the pace a bit. The course was very flat and wound its way through residential neighborhoods and parks.\n\nMiles 4-5 I was still feeling really good. Breathing rate was in check and legs felt good.

I ordered a bowl of wild rice from room service that probably cost me more than the entire stock of rice in the kitchen, but I didn't eat much on the plane except for a granola bar and was afraid I had already screwed up my carbo-load plan. \n\nSaturday we went to breakfast where I promptly sobbed incoherently to the 5k runner next to us about how nervous I was and got some good race-day tips.

Before the race I had a couple spoons of honey peanut butter.\n\n**Race**-The weather was a little cold at the start of the race. The course is designed for both a 10K and a 5K. The 10K runs the course twice. I was able to run the first 5k without any breaks. I took a breather at the 5K line, and from then on I usually ran 2:30 and walked 0:30 until I finished the race. I was using the Runkeeper app that told me my pace every 3 minutes.  This course is slightly easier because it has very little elevation change.\n\n**Post Race** - I felt tired. My throat was very very dry during and after the race. I think it was a combination of dry cold air",

In order to save my quads for the second half, I restrained my pace at around a 6:55 down and just let myself chug up hills without modifying my form. This was also the section of my largest screwup. Because there was no wave start, all the marathon and half marathon runners started in one large group, the only distinction being the color of the bib. I thought this runner I'd been with was running the full so I started pacing off of him. Without realizing it, we had been clipping up hills at 7mpm and downhills from 6:30 to even 6:15 at one section. My quads were dead but I knew I'd have to be careful towards the second half because of these mistakes. I hit the GU's at the beginning of the 5th mile",

I eventually had to let up on this a bit because my left foot started hurting but the training was having a noticeable impact. I signed up for a Turkey Trot at the end of the month to see how far my training got me.\n\n### Pre-race\nGoing in I was thinking that below 25 minutes was a reasonable goal. I knew I was faster than I was when I got 26:40, but I didn't really know by how much. My Fitbit's mileage was not always consistent or accurate and I didn't know how much race day would affect my pace.\n\nMy mom and I ran this race but",

Finished at almost exactly 3hrs. \n\nGot in the groove in the first half mile or so, and just stuck to the pace.  Listened to an audiobook for the first half of the race, then nothing for the remainder and just enjoyed the views and sounds of the race. Didn't feel out of energy at any point doing the race.

As I continue on my way, dripping lemon-lime, I finally look down at my watch and realize that I've been going a little faster than I meant to, around a 10:36 pace. I feel pretty good, though, so I decide to just keep doing what I've been doing. The 10K runners branch off here, and the rest of us continue out towards the freeway. Someone is playing an old Lady Gaga song out of their car, which is more or less fine but I mourn the loss of the Bruno streak for a moment anyway.   \n\n\n\\### Mile 4  \nA very tall and beautiful woman decked out in clothing covered in the word VEGAN zooms past me.

For reference to the \u201cdifficulty\u201d of the runs, I\u2019m burning 700-1000 calories per my smart watch.\n\nFrom research on the topic dehydration is the biggest reason, but that\u2019s likely not the case for me because I\u2019m peeing a very pale yellow (sorry if TMI).

I've completed a few half marathons and am currently training for a marathon in November. Nearly every time I run about ten miles or more at a moderate effort I end up with a splitting headache at the back of my head starting an hour or two after my run. The only thing that will ease it is ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n\nI know the number one suspect is dehydration but I think I am drinking enough before and during.

I'm from the U.S., currently living in Ireland, and I've started training to run a full marathon somewhere in Europe sometime next May/June. I've run 2 halfs before, but have been out of the running game for a few months, so I want to give myself enough time to prepare. I was looking at either the Copenhagen, Stockholm, or Edinburgh marathons as they are all late May/early June. \n\nHas anyone here run any of those? Does anyone have any advice on course, elevation, general vibe, ease to get to/from race, etc? \n\nThanks!\n[u/ozvk (3 pts)]: Stockholm is well organized and around 15-20' participants. The [course](http://runinfinity.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Stockholm_Marathon_coursemap.jpg)",
        "ce with 40,000+ participants and b) in about 1.5 weeks. But the course is super flat (again, biased because I moved here last year but I'm familiar with the course since I've been running here for 8 months now). And you to past a few major landmarks (Brandenburg gate, victory column, Charlottenburg palace, checkpoint charlie, unten den linden etc...).\n[u/glamredhel69 (3 pts)]: Dingle half marathon in Ireland is one of the most scenic and best I've done.

        "n 24-48 hours in your email\n[u/Practical_Cherry8308 (62 pts)]: as far as i know there isn\u2019t any solid science on massage guns.\n\npersonally i like to use a theragun after my workouts because i think it feels good and helps me relax. i haven\u2019t used any other brand though.\n\ni\u2019d say if you have the money and it sounds like something you\u2019d enjoy give it a shot. maybe see if you can try one out at a store or if a friend has one.\n  [u/making_shapes (39 pts)]: There also isn't any solid science on foam rolling. The stretching science is sketchy enough too. \n\nStrength and conditioning is the answer.\n    [u/doucelag (11 pts)]: Foam rolling absolutely works. Lack of evidence is not always evidence of a lack imo. \n\nThough i am 100% with you - strength is the only long-term answer\n    [u/Sage1969 (10",
        "[Post by u/obz2755 (18 pts)]\nTitle: Massage gun. Is it worth it?\nBeen thinking about investing in a massage gun. I suffer from soleus strains as well\nAs the normal leg aches and pains from long runs. Does it really help with recovery over foam rolling etc. The prices vary lots too. Looking on Amazon I can get a generic Chinese brand for about \u00a350-70 but some of the high end ones go for \u00a3250-\u00a3300, is there much of a difference ?\n[u/ImprovObsession (28 pts)]: I have a generic one and I like it. I don't know what could possibly make a high end one better. It's a fairly simple mechanism, no special physics or parts as I can tell.\n[u/TheEroSennin (19 pts)]: It does nothing for objective markers of recovery. However, if you enjoy it and you have the money and the time, by all means go for it.",
        "wait for my kids to walk in on me and ask what it is.\n    [u/Road_Journey (4 pts)]: Considering that vibrators were/are often marketed as body massagers, this brought me joy.\n    [u/Warlock- (11 pts)]: I second this. No better feeling in the world than using a massage gun on sore muscles.\n    [u/eoincasey78 (9 pts)]: Do they actually work?\n    [u/hennah17 (47 pts)]: I guess it depends on what you mean by \"work\"? Does it make me a faster runner? Eh, not really. But it's a good recovery tool, convenient, and helps keep me pain free. More versatile than foam rollers and can vary the intensity of the pressure easily. I can also just sit on the couch and use it, when I foam roll it always ends up feeling like a second workout to me.\n    [u/Early-Foot7307 (8 pts)]: Not sure if it works but",
        "y have routines that you can use on the app for specific workouts. I am not saying you need a theragun but look for ones that have directions or an app to guide you through how long to massage each section.\n  [u/FiveSeveN- (3 pts)]: About 3x cheaper, just as good, and quieter (based on what I've read):\n\nSonic X Massage Gun -  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V4G58H1/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_fabc_DXQSJ9R4KWCHRM682M29?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\n[u/runrgirl49 (7 pts)]: I\u2019ve got one, & find it really helps post long run. I\u2019ve got a foam roller which I never used as much as I should have, & actually use the massage gun, as it\u2019s so much easier to use.

I\u2019m just curious as my friend has offered to let me borrow hers and try it out and I haven\u2019t yet but maybe I should!\n  [u/_InTheDesert_ (6 pts)]: Yes, pre and post. My legs felt looser while running and I felt they recovered faster afterwards too. Just a great way to work out the tension built up from running (and day to day activities). It is great for all your muscles really, but as a runner I was amazed at how much stress was sitting in my legs. My quads also often get tight above my knees and along the laterals. A roller can only do so much.\n[u/Farquar-lazs (3 pts)]: I'm still on the fence about a massage gun. I've researched and read views but I'm still 50/50 about trying one. I've heard the best",

Do you notice any benefits? \n\nI am running around 35-50km/week (21-31 miles/week) but would like to increase my weekly mileage to 60-70 km/week (37-44miles/week) in the upcoming months. At the moment, I am experiencing some tightness in my calves (and maybe the beginning of shin splints? not sure though..) and am wondering whether a massage gun could help me recover faster / prevent this sort of tightness in the future.\n\nWhat do you think? I would not get the super expensive ones (like theragun / hypervolt) and would most likely try out a cheap one first (60\u00a3-90\u00a3,",

        "a small pinch of salt, but they're not going to be miles off.\n    [u/MRCHalifax (4 pts)]: I\u2019m male, 38, 6\u20192, 190 pounds. Calculators like [this one](https://keisan.casio.com/exec/system/1350959101) estimate 844 calories at a 10.8 kilometre pace. [Harvard has a page that talks about approximate calories burned for 30 minutes of activity at different body sizes](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diet-and-weight-loss/calories-burned-in-30-minutes-of-leisure-and-routine-activities); they say a 185 pound person running at 10 minutes per mile burns 888 calories per hour.\n\n In practice, the tracking devices I use produce similar results. I ran 10.77 kilometres on Thursday in a time of 1:00:33. My Fitbit thinks that was 884 calories. On the other wrist, Nike Run Club on my Apple Watch has that",
        "Bit more than that. Depends on weight, as you say. The general equation for general calories burnt is generally speaking:\n\nBodyweight in kg = calories per km. So says the general. Sounds like a good range, yeah. Strava is perfect. It tells me to eat pizzas. I find it isn't *that* far off with running, though?",

It uses actual effort to calculate your calories burned as opposed to a global average assumption.\n\nFWIW my HRM calculates about 30% fewer calories burned than those that use time/distance alone.\n[u/jobeus (5 pts)]: The only thing that's similar between any two calorie calculators is that they're both wrong...\n\nIt's far from an exact science and you need a lot more data than these devices usually have to figure it out. Different people vary wildly, one service chooses different algorithms based on all kinds of different reasons..\n[u/EmperorSelassieEye (3 pts)]: I could be wrong but I'm thinking",

        "oh yeah so probably just the shorter duration is the main reason it counted fewer calories i think the calorie burn calculation also takes into account heart rate so you can also compare average heart rate per session to see (but even if the second session is higher average heart rate, being 15 minutes shorter will lose a lot of \"calorie burn\") yeah im pretty sure it takes that into account there's various calculators on the internet but estimating calorie burn but at the end of the day it's",

The numbers are so close that I\u2019m chuffed with your formula however you found it. N=1 in my case as I\u2019m NOT informed on how it worked but it\u2019s nice napkin math",
        "ts)]: Try to use a calculator that implements heart rate as the formulas for calculating calorie expenditure with HR are considerably more accurate.\n[u/Ogroat (10 pts)]: It's probably an overestimation, but not absurdly so. [Check out this article on calories burned while running.](https://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning) The TL;DR of it is that you're burning about 100 (net) calories a mile.\n[u/running_thru_it (3 pts)]: You'll get a more accurate reading with a heart monitor.

So far the pain is mild, worse while load-bearing bent, located very specifically just below and to the inside of my knee cap, sensitive to pressure, and sometimes I can feel it click when going from bent to straight during a lunge. My mother says it sounds a lot like her torn meniscus, which just freaks me out so bad. She was a log distance runner for decades before this happened and decommissioned her. I JUST started.

Once I got to 20, I figured I just had to run my usual 6.4 mile loop near my home to make it a full marathon (with a little extra on top). Seemed easy enough but that last loop ended up being an extra hour of the most painful running I've ever done and I ended up hating myself and several life decisions that let to that point.

But at the same time, I'm not sure where exactly I went wrong. I was feeling so great and confident and boom out of no where everything just went the window. Looking back, I would say I was no where near ready in terms of my training, which is a little discouraging considering I put a lot of effort and dedication to the plan. I know I came out very quick but I didn't think it was TOO quick and that it would make much of a difference - maybe it did. All together, I conquered the distance, but I have a half a mind telling me I failed myself and failed the goal. The beautiful part about running is that there will always be another race, and luckily",

But, I still have a chip on my shoulder about it-- and still feel a tad defeated. Now that I think about it rationally, however, why am I being so ridiculous?

When I forget it, I typically have to hold my glasses onto my face because I can\u2019t see things like steps, bumps in the sidewalk\u2026 or trees on some occasions. \n\nI also have questions for contact wearers- do you wear them just for running and wear glasses",

This run + the preceding days of little / no running are likely quite sufficient to top off glycogen stores in much less effort than the old Ahlborg method. \n\nWhen you increase your carb intake, it\u2019s important to realize you\u2019re increasing the percentage of your diet made up of carbohydrates, you\u2019re not simply throwing more carbohydrates into the day on top of everything else.

I read that spike shoes can help you get better times. I have never used spike shoes however, and I was wondering if it was worth to try them. I know that in order to use this shoes correctly you need a certain technique. I guess my main doubt whether to try them or not is if the technique for running with these shoes is also the most efficient way to run without spikes. This is important to know because if the technique is the same I can always give it a try, but if it's different maybe I have to consider if it's worth spending time learning a running technique with spikes that I might not use unless I'm comfortable",

Thank you\n[u/liceri (7 pts)]: Exercice induced muscle cramps have, to the best of my knowledge, little to do with electrolyte imbalances. All that magnesium and salt and whatnot is, essentially, placebo. But that's important as what causes cramps is your brain telling your muscles to shut up in order to protect them from harm (keyword central governer). To avoid cramps you have to convince your governer, that you can succesfully complete the task you want. You do this by training and consuming what you are used to and what convices him that you can go on - like the impression of getting something salty/sweet which signals intake of energy.  \nPlease don't train to drink less.",

I learned from prior early morning test runs that I can't just roll out of bed and get out there without feeling like garbage. Choked down an egg and toast, drank a coffee, visited the toilet then made my way to Harajuku station. \n\nI arrived about 1.5 hours before the start so I dropped off my bag, warmed up, and messed with my phone.

The signs were confusing but I got by with my limited Japanese and asking around. Also, how insane that they basically put up and tore down the marathon within 24 hours?

        "[Post by u/codymy (6 pts)]\nTitle: What can a new runner do workout wise on their rest days?\nI (M/25) have picked up running in the past month or two to stay active during all of these. More recently, I\u2019ve caught the bug to want to run every day. I can\u2019t do any further than a 5k (granted I\u2019m walking half the time anyways), but rest days kind of drive me crazy because I don\u2019t know what to do with this routine I\u2019ve created for myself. I\u2019m mostly looking to just get in shape overall and keeping these good habits, so I\u2019m open to anything. Any and all advice is appreciated!\n[u/DrRFeynman (3 pts)]: I had 6 weeks to go from 3k to 30k. Let me tell you. It's swimming. Walk, run, jog in the shallow end. Also cycling. All my running friends who cycle are the best.\n[u/timmydee7 (3 pts)]: Yoga,",
        "[Post by u/_hexenhammer_ (8 pts)]\nTitle: How do you exercise on your rest days?\nClearly running is off the table, but I'm a newbie when it comes to exercise in general. Push-ups, sit-ups, apparently not crunches or squats (seen conflicting reports.)\n\nI know rest is just as important as exertion, so I don't want to jeopardize that, but 4 rest days vs. 3 exercise days seems kind of a lot if I'm just sitting around.\n[u/akohhh (17 pts)]: Strength sessions, yoga, swimming, walking, cycling/spin classes, no reason you can\u2019t do a mix of stuff\u2014I just wouldn\u2019t put a big legs day the day before your longest run of the week.\n[u/sennalvera (11 pts)]: Walking. It's low-impact but enough to gently work out any stiffness/soreness from a difficult run the day before. And the area I live is quite hilly so",
        "[Post by u/WhyArrest (3 pts)]\nTitle: What should I be doing on my rest days?\nHi, runnit!\n\nFinally got back into running. Over 2 weeks I have finally managed to get back up to 7k, where I was about two years ago. However I have clearly been pushing myself and not taking proper rest days.\n\nToday I am finally taking a day of not running but I'm bored, want to be out running, and feel like I'm making no progress. What are some activities I can do which allow my muscles to recover while keeping me active?\n[u/SahirPatel (7 pts)]: YOGA!!!! I never have rest days because I do yoga every day. It will help you in a lot of ways- relax, heal, energise and on and on.\n  [u/WhyArrest (3 pts)]: Just started to look into yoga! Funny you should mention it. Always been pretty flexible but I have no idea",
        "[Post by u/Santamente (13 pts)]\nTitle: Rest Day Activities\nShort version- heading into W3 for about the billionth time. The reason? I jump in ready to go, overestimate what I can handle, end up with some sort of injury near the end of W3, pout and do nothing for six months, then start over. Approaching things different this time, as I'm seeing the same pattern rearing its ugly head. So- what do you guys like to do on your off days to stay fit, keep your cardio up, and not injure yourself trying to run 5-6 days a week when your body isn't ready for that?\n[u/Lola_Bo (9 pts)]: I do weight training the days I\u2019m not running. 3 days weights, 3 days runs, then a nice walk on my day off from any proper exercise\n[u/xDaniellexMakeupx (7 pts)]: I only run 3 days a week and then either do weights, a",
        "thing I can do on days where I don't run? Should I continue the daily walking? should I do relaxed walking or firm/speed walking? any exercises that might help me?\n\nI'm also a little overweight, so I wonder if losing weight will help me with running or will it just tire me out quicker because I eat less?\n[u/BlueFirefly (4 pts)]: I do yoga. I\u2019ve found that running 3 times a week and yoga 3-4 times is a great combo - stretching/improved flexibility helps a lot with the running (hips and legs don\u2019t get sore) and the yoga helps build strength too.\n[u/Dankerbelle (3 pts)]: I walk on my rest days. Listen to your body and take some occasional true rest days.",
        "[Post by u/tinywombat (6 pts)]\nTitle: What are your activities on rest days?\nJust wondering what exercise you folks do on rest days. Looking for some ideas.\n\nAnd do you ever allow yourself an actual day of no exercise if you're feeling too  tired/sore from a run the previous day?\n[u/srhng (8 pts)]: Yoga yoga yoga! Compliments running perfectly. \n\nIf I'm not on a run day and I also can't be bothered for yoga, I try to get out on a walk or something. Nothing wrong with rest days, but I find if I let myself have a day of nothing it's super hard to get back into it later!\n[u/RoastedSquash (3 pts)]: Mostly just rest, doing normal non-exercise things. Sometimes I walk, swim, or bike.",
        "[Post by u/JustAGuyCalledChris (3 pts)]\nTitle: How do you handle rest days?\nLet me preface this with saying I am completely new to this\u2026I am 44 and haven\u2019t ran since high school. I just started the n2r program with run 1 being yesterday and today was my rest day so I did the strength routine but that just didn\u2019t feel like enough so I rode a stationary bike for 20 minutes also. I know with the program you are supposed to skip a day between runs to help stop injuries and recover so I am trying to figure out the best fill in for those days without just sitting around and being lazy.  Before starting the program I was alternating between walking the treadmill, riding a stationary bike, rowing machine, and strength training with dumbbells. I figure walking the treadmill would be a bad idea",
        "[Post by u/OiiGuzza (5 pts)]\nTitle: What can i do on rest days to keep active?\nI understand that there must be a 1 - 2 rest day between every run but i feel like i should be doing something on those rest says to keep active. What do you guys recommend other than running?\n[u/aussieketogirl (3 pts)]: You could just go for a walk or do some yoga",
        "[Post by u/5B3AST5 (5 pts)]\nTitle: What to do on off days\nSo today is my off day and it's my week 1 so what do I do? Is there things I should workout? I do lift but what can I do to improve myself for day 2?\n[u/Sea_Pea8536 (4 pts)]: Rest is the best thing you can do to improve between workouts, literally.\n[u/HappyCatDragon (4 pts)]: Honestly if you lift already the only thing i'd advise out of my own exoerience is focus on core muscles a bit more and stretch. Other than that you can walk as suggested.\n\nAnd yes rest days are also important. Many people underestimate the value of rest in workouts and improvement.",
        "[Post by u/gerbering (4 pts)]\nTitle: What to do on rest days?\nI feel like I should be doing something on my rest days... is talking a longer walk fine, or should I strictly be resting and doing minimal physical activity? I work a job where I am on my feet 8+ hours so walking a bit isn\u2019t too strenuous for me. My hamstrings are pretty sore though.\n\nAre there certain stretches I can do to make recovery faster? Is some weight training (for abs and arms) a good idea?\n\nThanks! I\u2019m looking to make the most of the current quarantine and get myself in tip top shape :)\n[u/NECalifornian25 (3 pts)]: I find bike riding to be really nice between run days, I can still get my heart rate up but don\u2019t have the impact on my knees and spine. I also like to do some upper body and core training on bike days."

I was extremely nervous, though we did have fun on Friday night and Saturday.\nOn Sunday, the day of the race, I woke up after a relatively good sleep, but could hardly eat.

Bag drop was very fast and easy. Went to the toilet then walked to the Champs Elysees where the start is. It was actually quite a distance from the bag drop to the start line.

I mean they are not THAT small but the average marathoner must be something like 5'6 while the average height in the US is like 5'9.\n\nI also noticed that the longer the distance is, the smaller the best runners will be. For example on a 100m race  you'll only see tall runners, but on a 5K you'll already notice that there are not super tall guys anymore. On a 10K it's still pretty well balanced. The difference between small and tall runners is becoming obvious on half marathons and on marathons imo.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there will always be this 6'2 marathoner who will be much better than 99% of small runners, but in general,",

I'm not training for a marathon or anything, but I won't rule out a 5K in a few years if I start to feel quick on my feet again.\n[u/Sivy17 (163 pts)]: Monday: Weights  \nTuesday: 10 mile run  \nWednesday: Weights and 5 mile run  \nThursday: 5 mile run  \nFriday: Weights  \nSaturday: 10 miles, pace  \nSunday: 20 miles, slow\n  [u/NewReplacement4995 (84 pts)]: That's only 50!

        "Ah okay, your answer was helpful. I'm currently averaging 30-40mi/week. Hopefully I'll get to 50mi week in the next few months. My S&C is slacking. I only have been working with kettlebells once weekly but haven't been consistent due to time. I'm assuming you're running 6-7 days to hit that mileage?",
        "es your week break down?\n\nedit for clarification. Run less per day but more days to get more overall miles. Just do what /u/freedomweasel said, he said it better.\n[u/FunnyHunnyBunny (10 pts)]: \"Now I'm thinking of breaking 18 min for 5K! I thought I would be satisfied with 20 min, but I want more!\"\n\nI don't think any of us are ever truly satisfied with whatever goal we break. You could also shoot for a 40 minute 10k.\n[u/johnmflores (9 pts)]: I hate you, tall, young, fast, thin, stranger.\n\n\nSigned,\n\nNone of the Above\n[u/tall_bob (8 pts)]: Dang!

I have an easy run day after weights / sessions.  Typically 2 days and I will drop an easy day if needed.  I have a soft target to run 5x a week.  I typically drop 1 day in 21.\n  [u/Relative_Beat6197 (3 pts)]: You manage 50+ MPW on only five days of running?  10 miles per day?  Is any of it speedwork?  Or just easy pace?  I run 60 MPW, and if I don\u2019t run each day (sometimes double) I just can\u2019t run that kind of mileage.\n    [u/Oli99uk (3 pts)]: I run 7 days a week.   Of that, 3 days are hard:\n\nTuesday Track - repeats like 16x200 this week\nFriday Track - longer intervals like 5x 4 minutes hard \nSunday - long Run at easy pace",

Other times I just continue to run 7 days a week with mostly easy runs. The vast majority of my runs are in the morning, before work during the week.\n  [u/kookalamanza (3 pts)]: This looks similar to me. How do you find doing your long run on a Saturday? I\u2019ve had to switch the days between Saturday and Sunday on occasion due to my partners work schedule, but I find I really feel the Sunday recovery when I do.\n    [u/pony_trekker (4 pts)]: Best thing about Saturday long run is drinking on Saturday night!\n[u/Jamied65 (17 pts)]: 50mile a week for me. I do a workout Tue and/or fri (depends on how I feel) and long",

Well, that depends.**\n\nSource: [here](http://running.competitor.com/2013/10/training/are-you-running-enough-miles_35813)\n\nwhich would mean that they run 4 times around 10k and one LDR with 18k.\n[u/Stalkercoffee (6 pts)]: I find there is a huge difference in perception of distance right here. I feel pretty good about running two six mile runs and one 3 miler. On here though lots of people run farther and more often.\n[u/TouchMyBox (5 pts)]: Hell, I thought 10K was a pretty crazy distance to run just a few months ago, now I'm disappointed in myself when I \"only\" go for a 10K."
